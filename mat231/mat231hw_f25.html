<p>
This course requires WebAssign, an online homework management system. A single-term subscription to WebAssign will also give you access to the electronic version of the book. To subscribe, check out the following exclusive link for Queens College students:  

<br><br>
<a href="https://www.cengage.com/coursepages/Queens_Math">Queens-Math on Cengage</a>
<br><br>

Please follow the instructions next to "Cengage/WebAssign" for how to register in our course. As a Queens College student you are eligible for a discounted price of $87 for the semester.<i> Note however that in order to use this discount, you must list Queens College as your school when creating your Cengage account.</i> 
<br><br>
In case you experience any problem with the process, contact Cengage's customer service or use their  <a href="https://events.cengage.com/82YEV5">virtual office hours</a> (January 13 to February 7 except Monday, Jan 20, 11:00AM â€“ 5:00PM).   
</p>

<p>
When creating a Cengage account, please use your real name and the same username as your QC account so I can easily identify you on my roster. To sign up for our class on WebAssign, you need the class key or link that I have sent to your QC email (I'll provide it again in class during the first lecture). You have a two-week free trial period during which you can read and do assignments. But I suggest that you purchase the access sooner than later, as it is a course requirement.      
</p>

<p>
Online assignments will be posted roughly every week. You can configure the system to send you automatic notifications when new homework is uploaded. You should complete each assignment before the due date, but you can do this in several sessions, saving your partial work each time. Some questions require entering an answer and others are multiple-choice. For the first type of questions, you are usually given 5 chances to submit the correct answer with no penalty for a wrong answer. For the multiple-choice questions, the number of allowed submissions is one less than the number of choices. Note that the numerics of each question may be randomized (that is, for each user a different random set of numbers may appear in the question).
