This course requires WebAssign, an online homework management system. A single-term subscription to WebAssign will also give you access to the electronic version of the book. If you're new to WebAssign, the following page, here is a <a href="https://help.cengage.com/webassign/WA_Student_Quick_Start.pdf">Quick Start Guide</a>. The following page provides additional information:

When creating a Cengage account, please use your real name and the same username as your QC account so I can easily identify you on my roster. To sign up for our class on WebAssign, you need the <b>class key</b> that I'll send to your QC email (I'll provide it again in class during the first lecture). You have a two-week free trial period during which you can read and do assignments. But I suggest that you purchase the access sooner than later, as it is a course requirement.      
</p>

<p>
Online assignments will be posted roughly every week. You can configure the system to send you automatic notifications when new homework is uploaded. You should complete each assignment before the due date, but you can do this in several sessions, saving your partial work each time. Some questions require entering an answer and others are multiple-choice. For the first type of questions, you are usually given 5 chances to submit the correct answer with no penalty for a wrong answer. For the multiple-choice questions, the number of allowed submissions is one less than the number of choices. Note that the numerics of each question may be randomized (that is, for each user a different random set of numbers may appear in the question).
