Description and goals:
</h3>
<p>
This is an introductory course in partial differential equations with some emphasis on the role of Fourier series and Fourier transforms in solving boundary value problems of mathematical physics. 
<br><br>
The primary goal is to introduce students to a number of useful techniques for solving classical partial differential equations. However, the course will be far from a "cookbook" approach to the subject. Theoretical aspects and important mathematical ideas will be discussed at length when appropriate.

<H3>General Information and Ground Rules:</H3>

<UL> 
<LI><b>Class lecture meetings</b> are Tuesdays and Thursdays 1:40-2:55PM in Kiely 320.  
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><b>Homework</b> is posted roughly every Friday and should be submitted electronically by the next Friday. Doing homework is an absolutely essential part of this course. You are encouraged to work in groups and discuss the problems with each other, but the work that you hand in must be your own write up. Late homework will never be accepted. 
<br><br>
You are encouraged to use packages such as <b>Mathematica</b> or <b>Maple</b>. I will give some animated demonstrations in class using such tools. 
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><b>Course grade</b> is based on the following scheme: 
<br><br>
<table border=2 cellpadding=10 width=300>
<tr>
<td align=center>Homework<td align=center>Midterm<td align=center>Final
<tr>
<td align=center>30%<td align=center>30%<td align=center>40%
</table>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><b>Midterm and final exams</b> will be take-home and given in the weeks of March 24 and May 19, repectively (exact dates TBA). 
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>Students registered in Math 663 are required to do a short project with possible class presentation, which will be 10% of their HW grade. 
</UL>	

<font color="red"><H4>Please take note of the following important rules:
</H4></font>

<UL>
<LI>The <b>prerequisite</b> for this course is MATH 223. If you have not taken MATH 223 or an equivalent course, you should not be enrolled in this class. Please go to the Math Department office (Kiely 243) and seek advice.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>If the midterm or final exam is missed because of a documented illness or valid emergency, the course grade will be determined on the basis of the other work done during the semester. An exam missed for other reasons will count as failure.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI> At the end of the semester, everyone who has not withdrawn from the class will receive a grade. Incompletes will not be given to avoid F's.
