<h3>
Description and goals:
</h3>
<p>
A closer, more rigorous look at the fundamental concepts of one-variable calculus. The main focus will be on the structure of real numbers and the key notions of convergence and continuity; the basic facts about differentiation and integration will be presented as illustrations of how these notions are used. The course provides a good opportunity for students to learn how to read and write rigorous proofs, and prepares them for further studies in analysis and topology.
<br><br>
The course is intended for motivated students, especially math majors, who have a solid background in calculus. An essential prerequisite for this course is the intellectual curiosity to learn about a nice piece of mathematics and the <i>willingness to think</i>.

<H3>General Information and Ground Rules:</H3>

<UL> 
<LI><b>Class lecture meetings</b> are Tuesdays and Thursdays 11:00AM - 12:50PM in Kiely 320. 
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><b>Practice problems</b> are posted roughly every week. You're supposed to work on them diligently before the solutions are posted. Your work on these problems won't be collected, but you should take this component of the course seriously as it directly impacts your understanding of the material. 
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><b>Quizzes</b> will be given on the dates designated in the course syllabus. They will be very short (1 or 2 little problems, 10-15 minutes) and based on the latest practice problems. 
</UL>

<UL>
<LI> The <b>exams</b> are scheduled as follows:
<br><br>
<table border=2 cellpadding=10 width=550>
<tr>
<td align=center>Midterm 1<td align=center>Midterm 2<td align=center>Final
<tr>
<td align=center>Thursday October 9<br>(in class)<td align=center>Thursday November 13<br>(in class)<td align=center>
TBA<br></table>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><b>Course grade</b> is based on the following scheme: 
<br><br>
<table border=2 cellpadding=10 width=480>
<tr>
<td align=center>Quizzes<td align=center>Two Midterms<td align=center>
Final Exam

<font color="red"><H4>Please take note of the following important rules:
</H4></font>

<UL>
<LI>The <b>prerequisite</b> for this course is MATH 201. If you have not successfully passed it, you should not 
be enrolled in this class. Please contact the Math Department office and seek advice.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI> If a midterm exam is missed because of a documented illness or valid emergency, the course grade will be determined on the basis of the other work done during the semester. Exams missed for other reasons will count as failures. In any case, there will be no makeup exam. 
</UL>

<UL>
<LI> At the end of the semester, everyone who has not withdrawn from the class will receive a grade. Incompletes will
not be given to avoid F's.
