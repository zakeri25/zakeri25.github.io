The main text used for our course is

<UL>
<b>S. Lay and R. Ligo, <i>Analysis with an introduction to proof</i>, 6th edition, Pearson, 2024.</b> 
</UL>
<a href="https://www.pearson.com/en-us/subject-catalog/p/analysis-with-an-introduction-to-proof/P200000009713/9780137871735?srsltid=AfmBOopu6dQryawZv5u6R73nxJDLMTF-ruwAcSbHOScz1BRTwb8cESRs">The publisher</a> offers the e-textbook at $9.99 per month. It is also okay to get the 5th edition of the book in case you find a cheap copy on the market.

My lectures and the textbook provide enough material for you during this semester. Here are additional optional references that can be used as guides, supplementary readings, or sources of examples and problems. These books are all available at QC library:

<UL>
<b>J. Marsden and M. Hoffman, <i>Elementary Classical Analysis</i>, 2nd edition, Freeman, 1993.</b>
</UL>
A standard introductory text. It has good explanations, nice pictures, many exercises. It contains much more material than we intend to cover in this course. 

<UL>
<b>R. P. Boas, <i>A Primer of Real Functions</i>, 4th edition, Mathematical Association of America, 1996.</b>
</UL>
This is not a textbook per se, but it is an outstanding monograph written by a master expositor in a lively and exciting style. It contains many nice examples and
counterexamples, curious constructions, etc.

<UL>
<b>W. Rudin, <i>Principles of Mathematical Analysis</i>, 3rd edition, McGraw-Hill, 1976.</b>
</UL>
This is still the best available text on Mathematical Analysis, though it is somewhat advanced for this course. Highly recommended for those who want to go to graduate school in math or closely related fields.
